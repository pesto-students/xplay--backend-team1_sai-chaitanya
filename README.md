# XPlay

XPlay is a platform to watch interactive movies and enjoy watch parties across friends.

It is designed to attract various users from the video game and movie industry. XPlay is a platform where one or more viewers can interact with the film and influence the events that unfold in the film.

XPlay allows users to watch interactive movies on Smart Devices, with ease.

## Who is this for?

All the users from OTT platform and gaming industry who want to be able to interact with the movies/ alter what they are watching on their Smart devices connected to the internet.

## How do they Benefit?

XPlay is a platform where viewers can interact with the film and influence the events that unfold in the film.

## How is this different?

In a regular movie/cinematic experience, the viewer lacks the option to alter events unfolding within the film. In video games, the player is given the freedom to interact with the game and alter the storyline.

Interactive movies are a combination of both cinematic experience and altering the storyline as per the user's choice.

The goal of XPlay is to give the viewer the possibility to alter the story, while still enjoying a cinematic experience.
